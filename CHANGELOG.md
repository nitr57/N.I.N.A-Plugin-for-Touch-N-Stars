# Touch 'N' Stars

## Unreleased
- Persistent Celestia Atlas data (landscapes, DSS survey) now lives in `NINA\TnsCache` next to the other plugin data; an existing `NINA\Touch-N-Stars` tree is moved there once
- Atlas DSS survey download: new `/api/atlas/survey/*` endpoints (status, download, cancel, delete) fetch the DSS colour HiPS tile by tile onto the host as 512 px JPEG and serve it at `/celestia-atlas-data/surveys/dss` from the persistent data directory; resumable, one job at a time
- Atlas DSS survey delete now accepts an optional `keepOrder` to downgrade to a lower order instead of always wiping the whole survey
- Keep advertising the `_touchnstars._tcp` service and its active port on
  Linux while sharing hostname ownership with the system Avahi daemon.
- Package and serve the `celestia-atlas-data` application directory.
- Keep generated Celestia Atlas landscapes in persistent N.I.N.A. user data and
  migrate existing app-local landscapes without overwriting user content.
