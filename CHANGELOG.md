# Touch 'N' Stars

## Unreleased
- Internal guider API: `POST /api/internal-guider/select-star` makes the star nearest a position in the guide frame the guide star while the guider is looping, for choosing the guide star by tapping it; see `INTERNAL_GUIDER_API.md`
- Persistent Celestia Atlas data (landscapes, DSS survey) now lives in `NINA\TnsCache` next to the other plugin data; an existing `NINA\Touch-N-Stars` tree is moved there once
- Atlas DSS survey download: new `/api/atlas/survey/*` endpoints (status, download, cancel, delete) fetch the DSS colour HiPS tile by tile onto the host as 512 px JPEG and serve it at `/celestia-atlas-data/surveys/dss` from the persistent data directory; resumable, one job at a time
- Atlas DSS survey delete now accepts an optional `keepOrder` to downgrade to a lower order instead of always wiping the whole survey
- Keep advertising the `_touchnstars._tcp` service and its active port on
  Linux while sharing hostname ownership with the system Avahi daemon.
- Package and serve the `celestia-atlas-data` application directory.
- Keep generated Celestia Atlas landscapes in persistent N.I.N.A. user data and
  migrate existing app-local landscapes without overwriting user content.
- Atlas NSNS narrowband survey (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0): the survey endpoints take an optional `survey` (`dss` default, `nsns` colour composite ohs8, `nsns-ha`, `nsns-oiii`, `nsns-sii` single lines); NSNS tiles inside its Moc.fits coverage are fetched from simg.de, stored as JPEG q85 and served at `/celestia-atlas-data/surveys/nsns`; only one survey download runs at a time
- `/api/sequence/move` moves items, triggers and conditions across containers: the target sibling may sit in another container, and a container `targetId` without `insertAfter` moves into it; the object keeps its id, children and settings, a container cannot be moved into itself and the start/target/end areas stay in place
